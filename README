web_demo is a full fledged OTP Release using the web_* applications located at
http://github.com/asceth and using mochiweb which can be grabbed from github
as well.  It is designed to be used with faxien/sinan:

http://www.erlware.org/erlware/index.html


web_demo assumes you have the required dependencies in the deps/ folder as the
lib/ folder symlinks to that folder for its applications.

Personally I have symlinks inside the deps/ folder as well that point to where
I store the applications.  The deps/ folder doesn't reflect this so you have
the freedom to set it up as you wish.


Make sure you build the driver in the adv_crypto application before trying
to run this OTP release.

Once you have that built and faxien and sinan installed you use these
commands to get going:

sinan build (make sure it pulls dependencies not locally installed)
sinan dist (packages it up as a release)
faxien install-release (tells faxien to install the release to your system)

Then assuming you've added /usr/local/erlware/bin to your PATH (or wherever
you installed it) you can simply run:

web_demo


Wait a few seconds and check the directory you ran the web_demo from, if
no erl_crash.dump appears you should be able to browse to
http://localhost:8000/about and get your message.  Going to other pages
should give you a 403 error.
